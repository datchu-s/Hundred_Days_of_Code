# My 100 Days of Python Journey
Welcome to my personal coding journal! This repository serves as a timeline, capturing the essence of my 100-day Python coding journey. From the most basic scripts to advanced projects, this is a reflection of my growth and exploration in the world of Python.

# Why 100 Days?
The goal is not just to code for 100 days but to witness the evolution of my coding skills. Each project is a chapter in my coding story, starting from the basics and evolving into more intricate, professional-level work.


# Personal Note
Each project here is a snapshot of my coding journeyâ€”a record of challenges overcome, lessons learned, and skills acquired. This repository is my coding diary, and I invite you to join me in reliving the moments of discovery and growth.

Feel free to explore, reflect, and share your thoughts. Here's to 100 days of coding and self-discovery! ðŸš€
